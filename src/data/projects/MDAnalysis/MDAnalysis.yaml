short_description: >-
  MDAnalysis is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of
  many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions
  of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is widely used in the scientific
  community and is written by scientists for scientists.
technical_details: >-
  The **goal of MDAnalysis** is to make it easy for users to analyze data that
  are produced by simulations (primarily [molecular
  dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulations) that
  run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis
  accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks
  that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of
  the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to
  interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust
  foundational library that can form the basis for new [computational
  tools](https://www.mdanalysis.org/2019/04/20/mdanalysis-as-a-building-block/).
applications: >-
  MDAnalysis is a project _written by scientists for scientists_ and is used for
  cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and
  materials research around the world in academia and national research labs.
  MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing [number of
  projects](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/used-by/) use MDAnalysis as their
  foundational library or integrate it.
