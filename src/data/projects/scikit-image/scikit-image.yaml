short_description: >-
  scikit\-image aims to be the reference library for scientific image analysis
  in Python.
technical_details: >-
  scikit\-image is a collection of algorithms for image processing and analysis,
  including functions for filtering, feature extraction, segmentation,
  measurement, and more. It is designed to work seamlessly within the scientific
  Python ecosystem, including the NumPy and SciPy libraries.
applications: >-
  scikit\-image has been used in industry, education, and academic research, in
  fields as disparate as biology and life sciences, materials science, remote
  sensing/satellite imaging, astrophysics, archaeology, and more. With a common
  API for 2D, 3D and higher-dimensional imaging, it is usable for a wide variety
  of imaging data. scikit\-image is also being used for pre- and post-processing
  and analysis with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and
  Chainer. With its focus on a clear API for reference algorithms, scikit\-image
  is also used in educational projects such as the SciPy Lecture Notes, the
  Python Data Science Handbook, and FastAI.
