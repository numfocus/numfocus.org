short_description: >-
  optimagic is a Python package for nonlinear optimization. It particularly well
  suited to solve difficult problems with or without constraints. Additional
  core functionality includes statistical inference on estimated parameters
technical_details: >-
  estimagic provides a unified interface to optimization algorithms from scipy,
  NlOpt, Pygmo, TAO, Cyipopt, and other Python packages. Adding new optimizers
  is easy and the long run goal is to support almost all optimizers with Python
  bindings. estimagic’s interface is familiar to anyone who has used scipy’s
  minimize function. At the same time, it is more powerful. Compared to using
  the underlying libraries directly, estimagic provides a lot of additional
  functionality. It adds statistical inference, sensitivity analyses, logging,
  error handling, multistart, and diagnostic tools, such as a realtime
  dashboard. A wide variety of data types are supported for the parameters being
  optimized, including numpy arrays, pandas objects, and nested dictionaries.
