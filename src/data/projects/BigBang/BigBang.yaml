short_description: >-
  BigBang is a toolkit for studying processes of open collaboration and
  deliberation, especially with respect to the production of digital
  infrastructures, to make them more transparent and accountable. This is
  achieved by utilising public communication channels and documents to reveal
  which actors are leading, following, or left out. It enables the analysis and
  visualisation of relationships, discourses, time series and knowledge
  networks.
