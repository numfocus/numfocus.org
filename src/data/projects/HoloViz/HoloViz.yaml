short_description: >-
  The **HoloViz project** is a set of open-source and interoperable tools for
  making sense of data at any scale, primarily through visualization in a web
  browser. These high-level tools are systematically layered, allowing users to
  quickly build with high-level interfaces and then drop down to lower levels
  when precise control is required. This layered approach results in
  visualizations that are immediately usable but can then continue to be
  inspected, pulled apart, reconfigured, and recomposed as needed. Whether
  conducting exploratory analysis or building complex dashboards, HoloViz tools
  are designed to work together to solve the entire problem of understanding and
  communicating data visually: hvPlot (interactive plotting built on Bokeh,
  Matplotlib, and Plotly), Panel (interactive apps and dashboards), Datashader
  (server-side rendering of large datasets), Colorcet (perceptually based
  colormapping), HoloViews and GeoViews (declarative high-level data description
  and plotting), Lumen (low-code and no-code plotting and apps), and Param
  (support for declarative parameter-based coding).
technical_details: >-
  HoloViz provides high-level tools that are designed to work together to solve
  the entire problem of visualization in the browser, from data exploration to
  dashboarding. Data exploration in HoloViz is based on a principle of
  associating data directly with its semantic description and keeping the
  original data accessible, even in complex visualizations. Dashboarding in
  HoloViz supports nearly all Python plotting libraries, works just as well in a
  Jupyter notebook as on a standalone secure web server, supports Python-backed
  and static or WASM-based HTML/JavaScript applications, and can be used to
  develop rich interactive applications without tying your domain-specific code
  to any particular GUI or web tools. The HoloViz approach results in research,
  data science, and engineering that is more interactive, concise, declarative,
  and reproducible.
applications: >-
  HoloViz tools are used widely in many different areas of research and data
  science, including earth science, finance, physics, and neuroscience, leading
  to millions of total HoloViz package downloads per month. For example, the
  Pangeo community uses HoloViz to conduct earth science research on big data
  that drives insights about our changing climate.
