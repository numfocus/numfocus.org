short_description: >-
  QuTiP is a software for simulating quantum systems. QuTiP aims to provide
  tools for user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of open quantum
  systems.
technical_details: >-
  It can be used to simulate a wide range of physical phenomenon in areas such
  as quantum optics, trapped ions, superconducting circuits and quantum
  nanomechanical resonators. In addition, it contains a number of other modules
  to simplify the numerical simulation and study of many topics in quantum
  physics such as quantum optimal control, quantum information, and computing.
