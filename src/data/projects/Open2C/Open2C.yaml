short_description: >-
  Open2C is a community that develops and maintains open-source tools for 3D
  chromosome biology and genomic data science, primarily in Python.
technical_details: >-
  We are particularly interested in 3D genomics, and most of the tools are
  focused on the analysis of data obtained using Hi-C and related
  high-throughput technologies. We like our tools to be easy to use, flexible,
  and scalable in order to facilitate active development of novel analytical
  approaches and to make use of the latest and largest datasets.
