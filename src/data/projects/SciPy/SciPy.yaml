short_description: >-
  SciPy provides fundamental numerical algorithms for scientific computing:
  statistics, numerical optimization, linear algebra, special functions,
  integration, interpolation, signal and image processing, and more. SciPy is a
  foundational building block for scientific and numerical computing in Python.
technical_details: >-
  SciPy provides fundamental numerical algorithms for scientific computing.
  SciPy is built on NumPy and is an important foundation for other well-known
  Python packages like scikit-learn (machine learning), scikit-image (image
  processing) and statsmodels (statistics).
applications: >-
  SciPy is used in virtually all fields of science and engineering. From major
  scientific endeavors like the LIGO project detecting gravitational waves and
  the first ever image of a black hole to individual scientists and teams in
  fields as diverse as economics, biology, and psychology.
