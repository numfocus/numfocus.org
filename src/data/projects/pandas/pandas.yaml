short_description: >-
  pandas is a data wrangling platform for Python widely adopted in the
  scientific computing community. pandas provides easy-to-use data ingestion,
  transformation, and export functions.
technical_details: >-
  pandas is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data
  structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
  pandasâ€™ data analysis and modeling features enable users to carry out their
  entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more
  domain-specific language like R.
applications: >-
  Due to its status as a foundational data wrangling tool, pandas is used in
  virtually every large company in tech and finance (e.g. Athena Capital
  Research, Two Sigma) and at every major university. It is used in national
  research labs such as the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
  Intercomparison (PCMDI).
