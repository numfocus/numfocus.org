short_description: >-
  [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) is a community promoting open, reproducible, and
  scalable geoscience. This community provides documentation, develops and
  maintains software, and deploys computing infrastructure to make scientific
  research and programming easier. The Pangeo software ecosystem involves open
  source tools such as Xarray, Iris, Dask, Holoviz, Jupyter, and many other
  packages. There is no single software package called “pangeo”; rather, the
  Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software,
  and computing infrastructure.
technical_details: >-
  Pangeo is a global and open community of scientific researchers and software
  developers working collaboratively to develop software and infrastructure to
  enable big data geoanalytics and research. Pangeo hosts regular community
  meetings, runs a Discourse Forum, and runs events at conferences. Pangeo also
  maintains a curated set of interconnected and interoperable software packages
  relevant to the geoscience community for cloud and high performance computing
  environments, including Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter.
applications: >-
  Pangeo environments are used across industry, academic, and government
  institutions around the world. Pangeo has also inspired several entities that
  are having a big impact in the broader computational science community,
  including 2i2c (operating JupyterHubs in the Cloud), Pangeo Forge (a
  cloud-native data pipeline and repository), and Project Pythia (an education
  hub for the geosciences). Other Pangeo use cases are featured in the Pangeo
  Gallery.
