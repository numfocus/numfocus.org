short_description: >-
  yt is a tool for querying, analyzing and visualizing objects or regions of
  interest to identify emergent properties in data available in a variety of
  real-world research data formats. Initially developed for use by professional
  astronomers, yt can be applied in a variety of domains including astrophysics,
  seismology, nuclear engineering, molecular dynamics, and oceanography.
technical_details: >-
  The yt project is a Python library for the analysis and visualization of
  volumetric data. It provides a uniform, physically motivated API for
  performing inquiry and visualization on data defined on particles as well as
  regular, adaptive, and unstructured meshes. It supports loading data in more
  than a dozen real-world research data formats used by domain specialists in
  the physical sciences working both real-world volumetric measurements and
  simulated data.
applications: >-
  yt has been used for projects within astrophysics as diverse as studying
  mass-accretion onto the first stars in the Universe, to studying the outflows
  from compact objects and supernovae, to the star formation history of
  galaxies. It has been used to analyze and visualize some of the largest
  simulations ever conducted, and visualizations generated by yt have been
  featured in planetarium shows such as Solar Superstorms created by the
  Advanced Visualization Lab at NCSA.
