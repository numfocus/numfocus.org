short_description: >-
  Project Optuna develops tools for optimizing deep learning and other tasks
  that use hyperparameters. Project Optuna is comprised of Optuna and Chainer.
technical_details: >-
  Optuna is an open source hyperparameter optimization framework to automate
  hyperparameter search. Optuna provides eager search spaces for automated
  search for optimal hyperparameters using Python conditionals, loops, and
  syntax, state-of-the-art algorithms to efficiently search large spaces and
  prune unpromising trials for faster results, and easy parallelization for
  hyperparameter searches over multiple threads or processes without modifying
  code.


  Chainer is a powerful, flexible, and intuitive deep learning framework, and
  other tools to automate machine learning in development as well, as part of
  its mission to simplify machine learning.
