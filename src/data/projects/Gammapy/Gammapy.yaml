short_description: >-
  **Gammapy** is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray
  astronomy built on Numpy, Scipy and Astropy. It is the core library for the
  CTA Science Tools but can also be used to analyse data from existing imaging
  atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS.
  It also provides some support for Fermi-LAT and HAWC data analysis.

applications: >-
  Gammapy is used for the reduction and analysis of data from multiple gamma-ray
  observatories, such as CTA, HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS. It can be used to create
  multispectral images of the gamma-ray sky, measure location, shape and spectra
  of gamma-ray sources in the universe and understand their connection to
  observations in other wavelength ranges such as x-ray, optical and radio
  emission.
