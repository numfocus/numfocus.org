short_description: >-
  Dask provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at
  scale for the tools you love.
technical_details: >-
  Dask is an open source library for natively scaling Python. It builds on
  existing Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to enable
  scalable computation on large datasets. In addition, Dask provides a general
  purpose framework to enable advanced users to build their own parallel
  applications. Dask enables analysts to scale from their multi-core laptop to
  thousand-node cluster.
applications: >-
  Dask is applied across a wide set of applications, just like the full PyData
  stack itself.Â  Dask was designed to scale the PyData stack generally and not
  for a specific application.
