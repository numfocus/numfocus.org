short_description: |-
  A unified codebase for Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models.
technical_details: >-
  ArviZ the library that Bayesian Modelers use for most of the steps that are
  not actual modeling. This includes diagnostics, results summary, and model
  comparison. By centralizing all this functionality, Probabilistic Programming
  Libraries and Probabilistic Programmers can focus on what they do best,
  performing inference!
applications: |-
  Supply chain Optimization  
  A/B Testing  
  Biomedical Research  
  Demand Forecasting  
  COVID Infectiousness modeling
