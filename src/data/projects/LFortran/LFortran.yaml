  LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler
  built on top of LLVM. It can execute user’s code interactively to allow
  exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to
  binaries with the goal to run user’s code on modern architectures such as
  multi-core CPUs and GPUs.
