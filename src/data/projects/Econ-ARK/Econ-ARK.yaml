  The aim of the Econ-ARK project is to make it easier for social scientists to
  do ‘structural modeling’ of economic choice behavior by providing a
  well-documented, open source codebase containing the core techniques in a way
  that can be relatively easily adapted to address many different questions in
  both macro- and microeconomics. ‘Structural’ modeling of economic choices aims
  to identify the logic or reasons behind observed behavior, rather than just
  describing that behavior statistically.

  The aim of the Econ-ARK project is to make it easier to do ‘structural
  modeling’ of agents’ economic choices by providing a well-documented, open
  source codebase that implements the core techniques in a form designed to be
  adaptable to many different questions in both macro- and microeconomics.
  ‘Structural’ modeling of economic behavior aims to identify a rigorous
  mathematical (or computational) description of the rationale or decision rules
  that generate observed data, rather than just describing those data
  statistically. Econ-ARK aims to produce plug-and-play software modules that
  can be relatively easily combined, enhanced and adapted to address most
  economic choice problems.
applications: >-
  The Econ-ARK originated as an initiative of the U.S. Consumer Financial
  Protection Bureau, with the aim of improving economists’ ability to model
  consumers’ financial decisions. It is being used for a number of ongoing
  research projects at CFPB. It also received early support and sponsorship from
  the International Monetary Fund, which is interested in improving its ability
  to model the consequences of heterogeneity and inequality across households,
  especially as they interact with public policy and social insurance programs.
  The Econ-ARK team has also given workshops at the Federal Reserve, at the
  CESifo conference, at the Computation in Economics and Finance conference, and
  at a joint conference sponsored by the US Treasury’s Office of FInancial
  Research, the Bank of England, and the Sloan Foundation; interactions with
  other central banks and policy institutions are ongoing, and researchers at
  several of these institutions are exploring the use of the toolkit for both
  policy and research purposes.
