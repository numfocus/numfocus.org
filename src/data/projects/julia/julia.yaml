short_description: >-
  Julia is a fast and user-friendly programming language for high-performance
  scientific computing.
technical_details: >-
  Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
  numerical computing. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed
  parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function
  library. Julia’s Base library, largely written in Julia itself, also
  integrates mature, best-of-breed open source C and Fortran libraries for
  linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string
  processing.
