short_description: >-
  FEniCS is an automated finite element library used to solve equations used in
  modeling, featuring a domain-specific language and automated code generation.
  Users input a problem that looks very much like mathematical notation; FEniCS
  then translates that into computer code. It solves problems for which there is
  no analytical (exact) solution numerically.
technical_details: >-
  FEniCS is a popular computing platform for partial differential equations
  (PDE) that enables users to quickly translate scientific models into efficient
  finite element code. FEniCS has been fundamentally designed for parallel
  processing and runs on a multitude of platforms, ranging from laptops to
  high-performance clusters.
applications: >-
  FEniCS has been used in both academic and industry contexts, such as at
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
