short_description: >-
  ipyvizzu is a data visualization tool that empowers data scientists and
  analysts to employ animation as a means of storytelling with data using
  Python.
technical_details: >-
   It allows users to create animated charts in Jupyter, Google Colab,
  Databricks, Kaggle, and Deepnote notebooks, among other platforms. Built on
  the open-source JavaScript/C++ charting library Vizzu, ipyvizzu leverages a
  unique morphing engine developed from scratch, which uses a single set of
  rules to describe all charts. This feature enables seamless transitions
  between different chart types. There is also a presentation extension to
  ipyvizzu, called ipyvizzu-story, that allows live presentation of animated
  data stories directly from notebooks, making it easier to share findings and
  engage audiences. Additionally, ipyvizzu and ipyvizzu-story are now embeddable
  in Streamlit and available in Panel, expanding their accessibility and
  integration options. By harnessing the power of animation, we aim to assist
  data scientists in effectively sharing their insights. To explore our tools’
  capabilities, please visit our documentation sites

  https://ipyvizzu-story.vizzuhq.com/latest/examples/) for examples and
  showcases.
