short_description: >-
  NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the
  structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
technical_details: >-
  **NetworkX** is an open-source library providing flexible data structures and
  a wide array of algorithms for creating and analyzing networks. The
  flexibility of the fundamental Graph objects enable users to construct
  arbitrarily complex networks, supporting a broad range of problems and
  applications.
applications: >-
  Network science is a diverse field encompassing a wide range of applications.
  **NetworkX** aims to provide a generic interface to the tools and concepts of
  network science, embracing investigation in many fields. Some common
  applications include analysis of social networks, biological and ecological
  applications (analysis of protein structure, population dynamics),
  neuroscience (analysis of neural networks), machine learning (neural networks
  in a different context), and many others. Note also that many fundamental
  computer science concepts and data structures (e.g. search algorithms, trees)
  are described in terms of network science. Thus many of the algorithms in
  NetworkX are ubiquitous in scientific computing.
