short_description: >-
  ITK is an open-source, cross-platform library that provides developers with an
  extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.  Developed through
  extreme programming methodologies, ITK builds on a proven, spatially-oriented
  architecture for processing, segmentation, and registration of scientific
  images in two, three, or more dimensions.
technical_details: >-
  The [Insight Toolkit (ITK)](https://itk.org/), is an open-source software
  toolkit for scientific image analysis, including registration and
  segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data
  found in a digitally sampled representation. Registration is the task of
  aligning or developing correspondences between data. For example, in the
  medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to
  combine the information contained in both.


  ITK is a cross-platform software. It uses a build environment known as CMake
  to manage platform specific project generation and compilation process in a
  platform-independent way. ITK is implemented in C++. ITK’s implementation
  style employs generic programming, which involves the use of templates to
  generate, at compile-time, code that can be applied generically to any class
  or data-type that supports the operations used by the template. The use of C++
  templating means that the code is highly efficient and many issues are
  discovered at compile-time, rather than at run-time during program execution.
  It also means that many of ITK’s algorithms can be applied to arbitrary
  spatial dimensions and pixel types.


  An automated wrapping system integrated with ITK generates an interface
  between C++ and a high level programming language Python. This enables rapid
  prototyping and faster exploration of ideas by shortening the
  edit-compile-execute cycle. In addition, the SimpleITK project provides a
  streamlined interface to ITK that is available for C++, Python, Java, CSharp,
  and R. The itk.js Node.js package combines Emscripten and ITK to enable
  high-performance spatial analysis in a JavaScript runtime environment. The
  itkwidgets for Jupyter provide interactive widgets to visualize images, point
  sets, and meshes.
applications: >-
  [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) is an open source software platform for
  medical image informatics, image processing, and three-dimensional
  visualization. Built over two decades through support from the National
  Institutes of Health and a worldwide developer community, Slicer brings free,
  powerful cross-platform processing tools to physicians, researchers, and the
  general public.


  [ITK-SNAP](http://www.itksnap.org/) is a software application used to segment
  structures in 3D medical images. ITK-SNAP provides semi-automatic segmentation
  using active contour methods, as well as manual delineation and image
  navigation. In addition to these core functions, ITK-SNAP offers many
  supporting utilities.
