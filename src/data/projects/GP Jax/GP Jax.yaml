short_description: >-
  GPJax is a Python library that enables Bayesian inference with Gaussian
  processes using JAX on both CPUs and GPUs. The abstractions provided by GPJax
  are designed to be tightly coupled with the underlying math, providing a
  framework that is intuitive to researchers and practitioners alike. Support
  for classification, regression, and decision making/Bayesian optimization are
  available thanks to work from numerous contributors.
