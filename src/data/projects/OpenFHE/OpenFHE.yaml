short_description: >-
  OpenFHE (formerly Palisade:
  [https://www.openfhe.org/​](https://www.openfhe.org/)) is an open-source
  project that provides efficient implementations of lattice cryptography
  building blocks and leading homomorphic encryption schemes. Originally
  developed by researchers in the cryptographic community, OpenFHE is actively
  being used by several groups in academics and industry (see the list at
  [https://www.openfhe.org/community/](https://www.openfhe.org/community/)) and
  is being incorporated into products to protect the privacy of individuals’
  data while allowing computation on that data.


  OpenFHE is designed for usability, providing simpler APIs, modularity,
  cross-platform support and integration of hardware accelerators.  OpenFHE
  complies with the
  [HomomorphicEncryption.org](http://homomorphicencryption.org) security
  standards for homomorphic encryption.  We offer OpenFHE under the 2-clause BSD
  open-source license, making it easier to wrap and redistribute OpenFHE in
  products.
technical_details: >-
  OpenFHE is a general lattice cryptography library that currently includes
  efficient implementations of the following lattice cryptography capabilities:


  *   Homomorphic Encryption (HE)

  *   Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren scheme (3 variants)

  *   Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan scheme

  *   Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song scheme

  *   FHEW (Ducas-Micciancio) scheme

  *   Stehle-Steinfeld scheme

  *   Proxy Re-Encryption for all HE schemes

  *   Digital Signature

  *   Identity-Based Encryption

  *   Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption
applications: >-
  CRANNOG: open source tools to conduct privacy-preserving statistical analysis
  and database linking for social science and economics. In partnership with the
  Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS) at the University of
  Michigan. This project is funded by the Sloan Foundation.
