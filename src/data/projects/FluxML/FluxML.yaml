short_description: >-
  Flux is 100% pure-Julia stack and provides lightweight abstractions on top of
  Juliaâ€™s native GPU and AD support. It makes easy things easy while remaining
  fully hackable and fast.
technical_details: >-
  Flux is written to be very generic, so that users can easily add in custom
  code to perform specific tasks, and interplay with machine learning models
  easily, be that custom types, custom numbers, arrays, recursion, control flow
  etc. We aim to support the full gamut of tools that the Julia language has to
  offer.
