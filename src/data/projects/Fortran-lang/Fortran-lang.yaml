short_description: >-
  **[Fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org)** is an open-source community that
  builds and maintains a set of modern tools and libraries for Fortran
  developers. Its main projects include the Fortran Standard Library, the
  Fortran Package Manager, and the Fortran website. Fortran-lang also maintains
  a growing ecosystem of canonical numerical and scientific libraries, editor
  plugins, and other tools. Finally, Fortran-lang provides an inclusive and
  welcoming online space for Fortran developers to collaborate and help each
  other.
technical_details: >-
  Fortran-lang is an open source organization that builds and maintains the
  modern Fortran stack of tools and libraries. It provides an extensive and
  performant standard library, a robust and easy to use build system and package
  manager for Fortran, C and C++, an editor extension for Visual Studio Code, an
  interactive online playground and a variety of numerical libraries all written
  almost exclusively in Fortran.


  Fortran-lang and the Fortran Standard: The Fortran Standard is developed by
  the international ISO committee (WG-5) comprised of several national
  committees including the US INCITS committee J3. While Fortran-lang
  collaborates with J3 and several Fortran-lang members are also J3 members,
  Fortran-lang is not directly responsible for, but is complementary to, the
  work done by J3 and WG5 committees on the design of the Fortran language
  specification.
applications: >-
  Fortran-lang provides a wide range of tooling for the Fortran language used in
  various contexts. The Fortran Package Manager (fpm), the Standard Library
  (stdlib) and Modern Fortran for Visual Studio Code are mostly used in academic
  research by individual researchers. Some notable examples where fpm is being
  used are a machine learning framework neural-fortran, the theoretical
  chemistry packages DFT-D3, DFT-D4 and GCP developed by Grimme Lab, SHTOOLS,
  tblite and over 400 other projects on GitHub.
