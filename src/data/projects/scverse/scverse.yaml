short_description: >-
  **scverse** is a consortium of foundational tools for analysis of omics data
  in life sciences. It has been founded to ensure the long-term maintenance of
  these core tools.
technical_details: >-
  scverse core tools facilitate sharing data through common formats, and provide
  foundational support for single cell datatypes and analyses. These tools
  benefit from shared maintenance and development in the scverse GitHub
  organization. scverse core tools are expected to interface with and be
  supplemented by other tools in the ecosystem. scverse strives for synergy and
  interoperability with the ecosystem of packages built around these core tools,
  to ultimately provide users to cutting-edge and varied selection of analysis
  methods.
applications: >-
  The growing adoption of Python for single cell omics data analysis has been
  catalyzed by our core tools. They are used in numerous research and industry
  projects across the globe and are referenced in thousands of academic
  publications. Around this infrastructure an ecosystem of packages has been
  created â€” extending single cell analysis to different modalities and
  addressing challenges at the cutting-edge of single cell research.
