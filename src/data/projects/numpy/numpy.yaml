short_description: >-
  NumPy is a universal data structure that fundamentally enables data analysis in numerical computing
  by permitting the exchange of data between algorithms. NumPy is a foundational project for the Python
  scientific computing stack.
technical_details: >-
  NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
  It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and record arrays),
  and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O,
  discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random number generation and much more.

applications: >-
  Due to its status as a foundational scientific computing package, NumPy is used in virtually every large company in tech and finance and at every major university. It has been used at the NBA; at Apple which ships NumPy as part of OSX, at Microsoft in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, and at Intel in the Intel Distribution for Python.
