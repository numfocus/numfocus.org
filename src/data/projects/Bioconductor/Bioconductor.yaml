short_description: >-
  **Bioconductor** is an open source, open development ecosystem of R-based
  software for bioinformatics. The project started around 2001 and has funding
  from the National Institutes of Health National Human Genome Research
  Institute and National Cancer Institute, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
  Bioconductor hosts, tests, and distributes over 2,000 R packages on genomic
  analysis methods by hundreds of active contributors. All packages are tested
  daily on Linux, Windows and Mac and are distributed globally with open
  licensing. Scientific, Technical, and Community Advisory boards meet on a
  regular basis. Annual conferences help disseminate new methods and tools for
  genome biology.
technical_details: >-
  Bioconductor is an open source software ecosystem and community providing
  high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools the
  analysis of genome scale experiments in the R programming language.
  Bioconductorâ€™s infrastructure helps developers reuse efficient data structures
  and genomic annotation to produce packages that run on all popular computing
  platforms.
applications: >-
  Owing to its 20 year history as a widely cited ecosystem for analysis of
  cutting edge assays in genome biology, Bioconductor is used in virtually all
  academic and industrial organizations involved with modern biotechnology.
