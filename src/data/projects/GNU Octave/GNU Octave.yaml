short_description: >-
  **GNU Octave** is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
  computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
  linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical
  experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may
  also be used as a batch-oriented language.Octave has extensive tools for
  solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of
  nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials,
  and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It
  is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in
  Octave’s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C,
  Fortran, or other languages. GNU Octave is also freely redistributable
  software. You may redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
  General Public License (GPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation.
  Octave was written by John W. Eaton and many others.
