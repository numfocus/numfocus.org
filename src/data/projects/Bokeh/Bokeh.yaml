technical_details: >-
  Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers
  for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of
  versatile graphics and to extend this capability with high-performance
  interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh helps people create rich
  explorations of data and models on the web, from wherever they are already
  comfortable and productive (i.e. Python or R). Bokeh can help anyone who would
  like to quickly and easily connect powerful PyData tools to interactive plots,
  dashboards, and data applications.
applications: >-
  Bokeh is a popular tool used across government, academia, and professional
  spheres including finance, medicine, oil and gas, data science, and others.
  Bokeh was originally funded through the DARPA XDATA initiative and has
  received additional support from Anaconda, Inc.


  Bokeh is used for finance, management, big data mining, graphing business
  patterns, web applications such as weather data and renewable energy
  forecasts, viewing energy production data, disaster resource management,
  displaying agricultural sensor data online, analysis of data from industrial
  machinery (wind turbines, trains, power plants), and mapping clinical trials
  using AERO plots, among many other uses.


  Astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore have been
  developing a suite of Bokeh server web apps to help figure out what it can do
  for their particular science aims. These tools also help STSI astronomers
  communicate with journalists, aerospace industry leaders, and members of
  Congress about the science of their mission.


  It is also used by computational biologists working to identify biomolecular
  markers that predict the therapeutic response of cancer patients, since Bokeh
  provides a framework for creating multiple interactive plots that can be
  linked to shared data sources (i.e. gene expression data).
