short_description: >-
  Effective Quadratures is an open-source library for uncertainty
  quantification, machine learning, optimisation, numerical integration and
  dimension reduction â€“ all using orthogonal polynomials.
technical_details: >-
  It is particularly useful for models / problems where output quantities of
  interest are smooth and continuous; to this extent it has found widespread
  applications in computational engineering models (finite elements,
  computational fluid dynamics, etc). It is built on the latest research within
  these areas and has both deterministic and randomized algorithms.
