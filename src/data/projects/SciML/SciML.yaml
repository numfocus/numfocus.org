short_description: >-
  SciML is an open source software organization created to unify the packages
  for scientific machine learning. This includes the development of modular
  scientific simulation support software, such as differential equation solvers,
  along with the methodologies for inverse problems and automated model
  discovery. By providing a diverse set of tools with a common interface, we
  provide a modular, easily-extendable, and highly performant ecosystem for
  handling a wide variety of scientific simulations.

  SciML tools are used by many organizations, such as (but not limited to!) the
  CliMA: Climate Modeling Alliance, the  

  New York Federal Reserve Bank, the Julia Robotics community, Pumas-AI:
  Pharmaceutical Modeling and Simulation, and the Brazilian National Institute
  for Space Research (INPE).
