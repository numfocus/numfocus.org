short_description: >-
  SkyPy is an open-source Python package for simulating the astrophysical sky.
  It comprises a library of physical and empirical models across a range of
  observables and a command-line script to run end-to-end simulations.
technical_details: >-
  The library provides functions to sample realisations of sources and their
  associated properties from probability distributions. Simulation pipelines are
  constructed from these models using a YAML-based configuration syntax, while
  task scheduling and data dependencies are handled internally and the modular
  design allows users to interface with external software. SkyPy is developed
  and maintained by a diverse community of domain experts with a focus on
  software sustainability and interoperability. By fostering co-development, it
  provides a framework for correlated simulations of a range of cosmological
  probes including galaxy populations, large-scale structure, the cosmic
  microwave background, supernovae and gravitational waves.
