short_description: >-
  PyTables is an efficient method for storing and querying both numerical and
  textual data. PyTables provides seamless access to the convenient HDF5
  library, a popular container for datasets that can grow to terabytes and
  beyond. With its support of the ultra-fast Blosc compressor, PyTables
  optimizes memory and disk resources so that data takes up far less space than
  other solutions, without allowing compression to slow down your data
  management.
technical_details: >-
  PyTables is a Python package for storing and querying large tabular datasets
  in an efficient way. PyTables is built on top of the HDF5 library and the
  NumPy and numexpr packages; these provide the foundations for very compact
  storage and high performance data management. Moreover, PyTables comes with
  OPSI, an indexing engine meant to work with datasets exceeding the RAM
  capacity while allowing query times to be competitive against engines in
  relational databases. Finally, PyTables comes with the high-speed Blosc
  compressor, making the overhead of compression typically negligible in terms
  of performance (and many times even beneficial) when dealing with large
  datasets, even when they are in-memory.
applications: >-
  PyTables has been used in a variety of both academic and industry contexts,
  including at: CalTech, the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab at CalTech, Universitat
  Politècnica de València, University of Southampton School of Engineering
  Sciences, Max Planck Gesellschaft, SLAC, ACUSIM Software, NOAA, General
  Dynamics, Germanischer Lloyd, SarVision, cellzome, and TeraView.
