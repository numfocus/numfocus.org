short_description: >-
  The **Scientific Python** \*\*ecosystem\*\* is a loose federation of
  \*\*community\*\* developed and owned Python projects widely used in
  scientific research, technical computing, and data science. The Scientific
  Python project aims to coordinate the ecosystem better and prepare Scientific
  Python for the next decade.
technical_details: >-
  With an extensive and high-quality ecosystem of libraries, scientific Python
  has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis. This ecosystem is
  sustained by independent volunteers with separate mailing lists, websites,
  roadmaps, documentation, engineering and packaging solutions, and governance
  structures.


  This project aims to coordinate the ecosystem better and prepare scientific
  Python for the next decade of data science.
applications: |-
  Government, Higher Education, Finance, Business Applications, etc.
