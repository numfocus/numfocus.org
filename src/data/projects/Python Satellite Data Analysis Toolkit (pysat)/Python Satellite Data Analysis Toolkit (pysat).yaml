short_description: >-
  pysat implements the general process of space science data analysis, from
  beginning to end, in an instrument-independent manner.
technical_details: >-
  This toolkit uses an Instrument object that enables systematic but versatile
  analysis of science data from a variety of platforms within a single
  easy-to-use interface, abstracting away all of the tedious file, data
  handling, and processing issues. Basic functions such as downloading, loading,
  and cleaning are included for all supported instruments/data sets. While
  incubated in a space science environment, pysat is capable of processing the
  worldâ€™s data.
