technical_details: >-
  PyMC is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic
  Machine Learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and
  variational fitting algorithms. PyMC features intuitive model specification
  syntax, powerful sampling algorithms, variational inference, and transparent
  support for missing value imputation. It relies on Theano, which provides
  computation optimization and dynamic C compilation, NumPy broadcasting and
  advanced indexing, linear algebra operators, and simple extensibility.
applications: >-
  PyMC enjoys wide adoption in industry. Quantopian uses PyMC to track
  uncertainty in the performance of a trading algorithm. We Are Wizards uses
  PyMC3 to evaluate A/B test performance. VoiceBox Technologies uses PyMC to
  compare algorithm performances using Kruschkeâ€™s BEST algorithm. PyMC is used
  in research code at Channel 4 for developing internal forecasting tools.
  Managed by Q uses PyMC for all of their statistical modeling, including A/B
  test analysis, sales forecasting, and churn prediction. PyMC is used as a
  primary tool for statistical modeling at Salesforce, where they use it to
  build hierarchical models to evaluate varying effects in web experiments and
  then to build meta-analyses that quantify the expected returns of a subsequent
  experiment. It has also been used at Monetate, GrubHub, and DataXu.
