  animations. With its simple, yet versatile interface, everyone is able to
  produce insightful visualizations.

  For example, it allows linking mathematical formulas to colours and shapes,
  thus bringing them to life and making them easy to grasp. While the core focus

  been used to create animations in the context of biology, chemistry, and even
  music theory.
