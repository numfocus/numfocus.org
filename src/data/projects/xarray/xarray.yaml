short_description: >-
  Xarray is an open source library providing high-level, easy-to-use data
  structures and analysis tools for working with multidimensional labeled
  datasets and arrays in Python.
technical_details: >-
  Xarray is a Python library that provides data structures and tools for working
  with multidimensional labeled datasets and arrays. Xarray enables users to
  perform operations on complex datasets. Xarray interoperates with many of the
  core libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem making it a powerful
  high-level tool for data analysis.
applications: |-
  Xarray has been used in a [wide](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&authuser=1&cites=7605314348902559849) [variety](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/faq.html#what-other-projects-leverage-xarray) of academic and industry contexts for applications as varied as weather/climate, computational physics, astronomy, biology, econometrics, machine learning and finance. It is a core component of [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/), a community platform for Big Data geoscience.

  Examples of results enabled by xarray include:

  *   modeling the environmental and [socioeconomic impacts of climate change](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf45/meta)
  *   understanding the [life cycle of viruses](https://elifesciences.org/articles/32942) from single-cell RNA sequencing data
  *   measuring the [speed of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04375) in a telescope survey
