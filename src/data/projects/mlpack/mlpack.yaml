short_description: >-
  mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library suitable for bothÂ data
  science prototyping and deployment.
technical_details: >-
  mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that aims
  to provide fast, extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine learning
  algorithms. mlpack provides these algorithms as simple command-line programs,
  Python bindings, and C++ classes which can then be integrated into
  larger-scale machine learning solutions.
applications: >-
  mlpack was originally developed as a vehicle to implement and test fast
  machine learning algorithms published at top conferences, like ICML, KDD, and
  NeurIPS. This academic background has led to mlpack being used in many
  scientific publications both inside the machine learning community and in
  adjacent fields. mlpack is an increasingly popular choice for general data
  science applications, with over 3000 stars on Github at the time of this
  writing (November 2019).
