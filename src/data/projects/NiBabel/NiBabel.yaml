short_description: >-
  **NiBabel** is an input/output library for brain imaging, providing Python
  interfaces to common medical and neuroimaging file formats, including:
  ANALYZE, GIFTI, NIfTI1, NIfTI2, CIFTI-2, MINC1, MINC2, AFNI BRIK/HEAD, MGH,
  ECAT, Philips PAR/REC, and FreeSurfer geometry, annotation and morphometry
  files.
technical_details: >-
  **NiBabel** is an open source library providing read/write access to common
  neuroimaging file formats for the Python programming language. NiBabel and
  Python form a workbench for neuroimaging analysis, and it is the base library
  for many tools implementing higher level processing.
applications: >-
  Virtually all Python projects that interact with neuroimaging data rely on
  **NiBabel** for I/O, including Nilearn (statistical and machine learning),
  DIPY (computational anatomy), PyMVPA (multivariate pattern analysis), MNE
  (electrophysiology) and MONAI and NiftyNet (deep learning). Neuroimaging
  software suites such as AFNI, FSL and ANTs use NiBabel for accompanying Python
  modules. Additionally, because data are exposed through numpy arrays, there
  are many free-standing projects that apply deep learning techniques to
  neuroimaging data using a combination of NiBabel and a library such as Pytorch
  or Tensorflow.
