short_description: >-
  Scikit–learn is a Python library for machine learning, and is one of the most
  widely used tools for supervised and unsupervised
  machine learning. Scikit–learn provides an easy-to-use, consistent interface
  to a large collection of machine learning models, as well as tools for model
  evaluation and data preparation.
technical_details: >-
  Scikit–learn focuses on effective implementations of widely used
  machine learning algorithms, with a focus on supervised and
  unsupervised learning. In particular, it allows practitioners to quickly build
  complex machine learning pipelines and easily swap out different
  models. Scikit–learn is built on top of numpy arrays, and therefore focuses on
  in-memory models of homogeneous data, though some support for out-of-core
  computations and heterogeneous data exist. Implementations rely either on
  vectorized computations with numpy, or efficient low-level implementations in
  Cython.
applications: >-
  Scikit–learn is widely used across industry and research. Applications range
  from finding exoplanets to fraud detection in credit card transactions to
  analyzing brain imaging data. Scikit–learn is used at tech companies such as
  Amazon and Microsoft as well as in manufacturing processes in companies like
  Mars, Inc.
