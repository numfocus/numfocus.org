short_description: >-
  Awkward Array is a Python library for nested, variable-sized data, including
  arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using
  NumPy-like idioms.
technical_details: >-
  Arrays are dynamically typed, but operations on them are compiled and fast.
  Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular and
  generalizes when theyâ€™re not.
