short_description: >-
  Conda-forge builds and distributes software packages, specializing in the
  hard-to-build or unique packages that often arise in a scientific computing
  context. Conda-forge is community-driven and community-curated. This means
  that no package is too domain-specific and all packages undergo review to
  ensure quality and interoperability. Conda-forge has a federated structure,
  where each package has its own list of maintainers, which anyone can join.
  This helps ensure that people who care about a package are the ones
  responsible for maintaining it. The conda-forge ecosystem is fully structured
  around automation. This lets our maintainers build packages for systems they
  do not own (like Windows or Mac), keep their packages up-to-date
  automatically, and ensure their packages maintain the highest level of
  quality.
technical_details: >-
  Conda-forge is a community-led collection of recipes, build infrastructure and
  distributions for the conda package manager. Our GitHub organization contains
  repositories of conda recipes. Thanks to some awesome continuous integration
  providers (AppVeyor, CircleCI and TravisCI), each repository, also known as a
  feedstock, automatically builds its own recipe in a clean and repeatable way
  on Windows, Linux and OSX.
applications: >-
  Conda-forge is the preferred way to install large parts of the PyData and R
  ecosystem. It is used throughout a disparate set of scientific computing
  domains, from Physics to Biology to Financial Technology and everything in
  between.
