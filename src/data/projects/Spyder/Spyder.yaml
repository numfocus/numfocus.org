short_description: >-
  **Spyder** is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python,
  and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It features a
  unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling
  functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration,
  interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization
  capabilities of a scientific package. The Spyder project also maintains a
  number of other popular tools in the PyData ecosystem and beyond, including
  Jupyter QtConsole, QtPy, QtAwesome, Python-LSP-Server, LogHub, Lektor-Icon,
  Docrepr and more, alongside a bevy of Spyder plugins.
