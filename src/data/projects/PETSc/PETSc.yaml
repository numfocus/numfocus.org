short_description: >-
  [PETSc](https://petsc.org)Â is a numerical algorithm software library widely
  used by scientists and engineers to write scientific simulations. Such
  simulations are used to understand the world better, and engineer improved
  processes and products.
technical_details: >-
  PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation, includes a
  large suite of scalable parallel linear and nonlinear equation solvers, ODE
  integrators, and optimization algorithms for application codes written in C,
  C++, Fortran, and Python. In addition, PETSc includes support for managing
  parallel PDE discretizations including parallel matrix and vector assembly
  routines.
applications: >-
  Acoustics, Aerodynamics, Air Pollution, Arterial Flow, Bone Fractures, Brain
  Surgery, Cancer Surgery, Cancer Treatment, Carbon Sequestration, Cardiology,
  Cells, CFD, Combustion, Concrete, Corrosion, Data Mining, Dentistry, Earth
