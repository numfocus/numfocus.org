short_description: >-
  The signac framework is a complete solution for managing workflows operating
  on file-based data designed to scale to HPC systems.
technical_details: >-
  By using a well-defined, indexable storage layout for data and metadata,
  signac streamlines generation of, access to, and analysis of data through a
  straightforward interface that naturally scales from laptops and workstations
  to leadership-class supercomputers. Additionally, operations on this data can
  be managed, parallelized, and easily submitted on supercomputing clusters.


  The project has been published in the Journal of Computational Materials
  Science (DOI:10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.01.035) and the Proceedings of the SciPy
  2018 conference (DOI:10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-016). It has also been presented
  at PyData Ann Arbor as well as eight scientific conferences in chemical
  engineering, materials science, and applied physics.
