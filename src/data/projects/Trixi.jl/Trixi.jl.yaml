short_description: >-
  Trixi.jl is a numerical simulation framework for conservation laws written in
  the Julia programming language.
technical_details: >-
  Example applications include high-speed flows with complex shock interactions,
  astrophysical simulations with self-gravity, shallow water problems for flood
  prediction, or computational aeroacoustics. A key objective for the framework
  is to be useful to both scientists and students. Therefore, next to having an
  extensible design with a fast implementation, Trixi.jl is focused on being
  easy to use for new or inexperienced users, including the installation and
  postprocessing procedures. We thus try to utilize the advantages of Julia for
  rapid prototyping and efficiency to make high-performance computing more
  accessible for a broader scientific audience.
