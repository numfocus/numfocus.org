short_description: >-
  rOpenSci creates technical and community infrastructure for open and
  reproducible research in the R language. It features a curated collection of
  over 300 R packages, an open software peer review system for
  community-contributed packages, a platform for building, testing, and
  publishing R packages, and documentation, and community engagement programs to
  support scientific R users and developers.
technical_details: >-
  rOpenSci creates packages that allow access to data repositories through the R
  statistical programming environment. We develop open source R packages that
  provide programmatic access to a variety of scientific data, full-text of
  journal articles, and repositories that provide real-time metrics of scholarly
  impact. Use our packages to acquire data (both your own and from various data
  sources), analyze it, add in your narrative, and generate a final publication
  in any one of widely used formats such as Word, PDF, or LaTeX. Our tools not
  only facilitate drawing data into an environment where it can readily be
  manipulated, but also one in which those analyses and methods can be easily
  shared, replicated, and extended by other researchers.
