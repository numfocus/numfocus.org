short_description: >-
  OpenMBEE is a community of Engineering Practitioners and Software Developers
  that seek to use Open Source as a means to expand the availability of
  Engineering Models and Software that connect technical information in a
  collaborative platform.


  Our Mission is to establish an Enterprise Platform capable of connecting
  technical content between different technical disciplines through a
  collaborative document interface. This platform is intended to additionally
  provide open source Engineering Models and establish a means to integrate
  large variety of modeling and analysis tools and languages.


  The origins of these assets come from the European Southern Observatory and
  the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory need for coordinating the complexity of
  building modern Telescopes and Robotics Spacecraft Using Software Development
  as a guide, we expect Engineering Modeling will leverage many of these
  capabilities and practices with additional novelty germane to the world of
  Engineering Modeling and Analysis. This is strongly evidenced by many of the
  NumFocus projects that already exist, such as Jupyter and the variety of
  Python-oriented analysis and visualization capabilities which have become
  main-stays of the Engineering Community.
technical_details: >-
  OpenMBEE is a software environment built to support Engineering Modeling and
  Analysis in a collaborative large-scale context. OpenMBEE provides Web
  Services and for integrating models and building Web Applications that use
  those models. These services also include Engineering Modeling App
  integrations e.g. Jupyter Lab as well as conventional desktop tools for
  integrating models and analysis. The most novel element is the ability to make
  web-based technical documents with cross-referenced information made common by
  the underlying engineering models.


  The Open MBEE Thirty Meter Telescope Model and supporting Modeling Cookbook
  models are key assets in Open Source Modeling for Systems Models. The Open
  MBEE Cookbooks in particular, demonstrate the ability to provide reusable
  descriptive models to facilitate an open collaborative process for engineering
  development. As with software applications, this is crucial for ensuring a
  robust resource of models with a foundation in precision, as is expected in
  successful Open Source resources.


  Another critical concept in the Open MBEE Architecture is the ability to make
  this descriptive information available as a resource. Like software code
  configuration management, versioning and organization are required. However,
  for descriptive models written in modeling languages for large systems, it is
  important to provide this information in a way that can be analyzed as well as
  consumed in formal technical human formats. The Open MBEE software originated
  at NASA JPL and the European Southern Observatory. It provides a Model
  Repository called the Model Management System (MMS), a web application called
  View Editor and a Code Generator called COMODO.
applications: >-
  OpenMBEE software and models have been applied to several international
  projects.  

  COMODO has been used for the ESO Very Large Telescope, the Very Large
  Telescope Interferometer, and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) control
  systems, generating production quality applications.


  The ESO model libraries for instrumentation have been used on the ELT project
  for design and implementation of the instrument control system.


  MMS, VE, and the MDKs have been used for JPL flight projects such as Mars2020,
  Europa Clipper, Europa Lander, Mars Sample Return, and Asteroid Redirect
  Retrieval Mission, creating and maintaining hundreds of engineering documents
  from models with millions of elements.


  The Thirty Meter Telescope Observatory has been using MMS, VE, and MDKs for
  creating engineering documentation from executable SysML models.  

  SERC used MMS, VE, and MDKs for its NAVAIR surrogate pilot project for
  sign-off handling of documents.
