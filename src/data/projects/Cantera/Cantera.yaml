short_description: >-
  Cantera is an open source software suite that helps users solve problems
  involving thermodynamics, chemical reaction rates, and fluid transport
  processes. The software is written to be flexible and efficient, handling
  these calculations in a way that lets the user shift their attention to other
  elements of their calculations.  Because it is open source, the software can
  be easily extended to support the needs of any particular researcher.
technical_details: >-
  Cantera is an open source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems
  involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes. The
  software automates the chemical kinetic, thermodynamic, and transport
  calculations so that the users can efficiently incorporate detailed chemical
  thermo-kinetics and transport models into their calculations.


  The code utilizes object-oriented concepts for robust yet flexible phase
  models, and algorithms are generalized so that users can explore different
  phase models with minimal changes to their overall code. Currently, Cantera
  can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written in C++ and
  Fortran 90.  Cantera also provides a limited number of solvers for
  time-dependent reactor networks and steady one-dimensional reacting flows.
applications: >-
  Cantera has been adopted by a wide range of users across diverse research
  fields.  Its largest user base is in the combustion field, but Cantera has
  also seen applications in energy storage (such as batteries and fuel cells),
  geochemistry, chemical processing, thin film deposition, plasma science, and
  atmospheric/astronomical chemistry.


  Cantera has been used in projects at a variety of research institutions and
  companies, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sandia National
  Laboratories, University of Connecticut, Argonne National Laboratories, Oregon
  State University, Siemens Canada, Northeastern University, Brown University,
  Bucknell University, University of Illinois at Chicago, Colorado School of
  Mines, Stanford University, Politecnico di Torino, Université d’Orléans,
  University of Florida, SouthWest University of Science and Technology (China),
  Polytechnic University of Milan, University of California – Irvine, University
  of Tokyo, DLR Stuttgart, Offenberg University of Applied Sciences, and many
  others.
