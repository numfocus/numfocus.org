short_description: >-
  **napari** is an n-dimensional image viewer in Python. It can view NumPy
  arrays as well as many others in the ecosystem, including Dask, Zarr, and
  Xarray.
technical_details: >-
  **napari** is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
  It’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
  images. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based
  rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy). We aim to maximize
  compatibility with as much of the scientific Python ecosystem as possible.
applications: >-
  **napari** is used to visualize imaging data from modern scientific
  instruments, such as lattice light sheet microscopes, which image 3D volumes
  of data over time. napari can also visualize the products of analyzing these
  images, such as object identities (called segmentations), keypoints, or motion
  fields. Together with its interactive annotation capabilities and growing
  plugin ecosystem, napari aims to become a powerful image visualization and
  analysis platform.
