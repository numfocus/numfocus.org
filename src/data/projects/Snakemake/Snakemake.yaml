  They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments,
  without the need to modify the workflow definition. Snakemake workflows can
  entail a description of required software, which will be automatically
  deployed to any execution environment. Finally, Snakemake can automatically
  generate server-free, graphical, interactive reports that connect the results
  of a data analyisis with the code, parameters, and software used for each
  step, ensuring data provenance and transparency. With on average more than 11
  new citations per week in 2023, and almost 950000 downloads on anaconda.org,
  Snakemake is extremely popular.
