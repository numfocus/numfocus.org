  Matplotlib is a flexible and customizable tool for producing static and
  interactive data visualizations.
technical_details: >-
  Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality
  figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
  platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython
  shell, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and seven graphical user
  interface toolkits. For simple plotting, the pyplot module provides a
  MATLAB-like interface, particularly when combined with IPython. Full control
  of line styles, font properties, axes properties, etc. is accessible via an
  object-oriented interface.
applications: >-
  Due to its status as a foundational data visualization tool, Matplotlib is
  used in heavily in academia, national research labs and in industry.
  Matplotlib is used in cutting-edge research, from physics to chemistry,
  neuroscience to astronomy. It has been used on high profile projects such as
  Mars landers and the Hubble space telescope. It is widely used in industry
  across many domains, including oil and gas, finance, meteorology, and
  scientific instruments. Matplotlibâ€™s website sees approximately 25,000
  individual visitors per workday, confirming its widespread adoption.
