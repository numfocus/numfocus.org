short_description: >-
  **PyBaMM** (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) solves physics-based
  electrochemical DAE models by using state-of-the-art automatic differentiation
  and numerical solvers. The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model can be solved in under
  0.1 seconds, while the reduced-order Single Particle Model and Single Particle
  Model with electrolyte can be solved in just a few milliseconds. Additional
  physics can easily be included such as thermal effects, fast particle
  diffusion, 3D effects, and more. All models are implemented in a flexible
  manner, and a wide range of models and parameter sets (NCA, NMC, LiCoO2, …)
  are available. There is also functionality to simulate any set of experimental
  instructions, such as CCCV or GITT, or specify drive cycles.

applications: >-
  PyBaMM is the largest open-source battery modelling package. It is primarily
  focused on lithium-ion batteries, but also includes models for other
  chemistries (such as lead-acid and lithium-metal). PyBaMM has been used by
  researchers at numerous companies and research institutions, including the
  University of Oxford, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Warwick,
  Imperial College London, National Physical Laboratory, Deutsches Zentrum für
  Luft- und Raumfahrt, and The Faraday Institution.
