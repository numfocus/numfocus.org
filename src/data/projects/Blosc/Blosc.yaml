short_description: >-
  Blosc is a very high performance meta-compressor specially designed for
  compressing binary data.
technical_details: >-
  Blosc is a high performance compression library written in C that uses the
  [blocking technique](http://www.blosc.org/docs/StarvingCPUs-CISE-2010.pdf) to
  make compression operations easier, faster, and more flexible. Blosc splits
  the datasets into blocks, then transparently packs them into compressed
  containers. Blosc extends standard compression by allowing the user to
  condition the data in every block with filters prior to the compression
  operation; these filters can be selected depending on the properties of the
  dataset to be compressed. In addition, Blosc provides a diversity of codecs to
  cover different needs (better compression, faster speed or a balance between
  the two). Finally, Blosc runs its operations in parallel to leverage the high
  number of cores in modern CPUs.
applications: >-
  Blosc is designed to help in any application where (binary) data needs to be
  compressed as fast as possible so as to minimize the impact in handling
  compressed data transparently.


  Blosc is currently used in many projects, among them
  [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/) (there is also a stand-alone
  [hdf5-blosc](https://github.com/Blosc/hdf5-blosc) plugin for general HDF5
  applications), [bcolz](https://bcolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and
  [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (via its
  [numcodecs](https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) subproject) and it is
  widely appreciated for its fast performance and stability. Via these projects
  Blosc is used in Earth Data Science, databases, the financial industry and
  many others. Hundreds of visitors access the different Blosc projects in
  GitHub on a daily basis.
