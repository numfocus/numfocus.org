short_description: >-
  TARDIS is a collection of tools to analyze observations from exploding stars
  and is widely adopted in the astrophysical community for cutting edge science.
  TARDIS is a multi-disciplinary collaboration applying new tools from
  artificial intelligence research and high-performance computing with an
  open-source development structure.
technical_details: >-
  TARDIS is an open-source collaboration for the radiative-transfer simulation
  of exploding stars and the analysis of their spectra. TARDIS uses standard
  open-source community software development workflow relying on GitHub for
  development, testing, and continuous integration.
applications: >-
  TARDIS is being used in modeling the observations of exploding stars and other
  astrophysical transients. These include but are not limited to exploding white
  dwarf stars, massive stars undergoing a core-collapse, and coalescing neutron
  stars.
