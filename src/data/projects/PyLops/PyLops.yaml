short_description: >-
  PyLops is a Python library which facilitates solving large-scale inverse
  problems.
technical_details: >-
  It provides many commonly used linear operators (e.g. convolution, wavelet
  transform, etc.) as matrix-free objects, and leverages them within iterative
  algorithms to solve ill-conditioned problems. Its high-level, expressive
  interface resembles the underlying mathematical formulation. Finally, it
  supports fully interchangeable CPU and GPU backends that are compatible with
  other native Python libraries such as NumPy and CuPy.
