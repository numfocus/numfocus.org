short_description: >-
  CuPy is a GPU-based Python library for data analysis in numerical computing.
  CuPy shares the same API as NumPy and SciPy, allowing the use of GPUs at a
  minimal learning cost and without the need for in-depth knowledge of low-level
  GPU programming.
technical_details: >-
  CuPy is an open source library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python,
  providing support for N-dimensional (dense) arrays, sparse matrices, and a
  variety of numerical algorithms implemented on top of them. CuPy acts as a
  drop-in replacement to run existing NumPy/SciPy code on NVIDIA CUDA or AMD
  ROCm platforms.
applications: >-
  **Projects in a variety of fields are built upon CuPy, including spaCy
  (natural language processing library), pomegranate (library for probabilistic
  modelling), RAPIDS (GPU data analysis suite by NVIDIA), PyQtGraph (graphics
  library for Qt), and turboSETI (Python based SETI search algorithm by UC
  Berkeley). See https://github.com/cupy/cupy/wiki/Projects-using-CuPy for more
  information.**
