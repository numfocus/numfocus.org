  Zarr: scalable storage of tensor data for scientific computing
technical_details: >-
  Zarr is a spec for storing chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays; several
  languagesâ€™ implementations of that spec; and an associated ecosystem of tools
  and integrations that use them.
applications: >-
  Zarr is broadly used in biomedicine (malaria genomics, scRNAseq, spatial
  transcriptomics, neuroscience, etc.) and beyond (many geoscience fields).


  It fills a need for simple, scalable N-dimensional array storage in the cloud
  era; scientists from many disciplines have flocked to it to solve a need
  historically filled by HDF5. It has a vibrant open ecosystem and distributed,
  grassroots developer-and user-base, and supports the NetCDF data model,
  allowing drop-in integration with a wide variety of systems and use-cases.
