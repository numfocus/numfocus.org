short_description: >-
  pomegranate is a Python module for fast and flexible probabilistic modeling
  inspired by the design of scikit-learn.
technical_details: >-
  A primary focus of pomegranate is to abstract away the intricacies of a model
  from its definition, allowing users to easily prototype with complex models
  and training strategies. Its modular implementation allows for probability
  distributions to be swapped in or out for each other with ease and for models
  to be stacked within each other, yielding such delights as a mixture of
  Bayesian networks or a Gaussian mixture model Bayes classifier.
