short_description: |-
  DyNDÂ is a C++ library for dynamic, multidimensional arrays.
technical_details: >-
  It is inspired by NumPy, the Python array programming library at the core of
  the scientific Python stack, but tries to address a number of obstacles
  encountered by some of its users. Examples of this are support for
  variable-sized string, ragged array types, and convenient usage from C++. The
  library is in a preview development state, and can be thought of as a sandbox
  where features are being tried and tweaked to gain experience with them.
