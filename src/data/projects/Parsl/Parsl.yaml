short_description: >-
  Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library that augments
  Python with simple constructs for encoding parallelism. Developers annotate
  Python functions (called apps) that can represent pure Python functions or
  calls to external applications, to specify opportunities for concurrent
  execution. Parsl allows invocations of these apps, called tasks, to be
  connected by shared input/output data (e.g., Python objects or files) via
  which Parsl constructs a dynamic dependency graph of tasks to manage
  concurrent task execution where possible. Parsl includes an extensible and
  scalable runtime that allows it to efficiently execute Parsl programs on one
  to hundreds of thousands of cores on laptops, clusters, supercomputers, and
  clouds.
technical_details: >-
  Parsl enables Python programmers to build existing functions and executables
  into a higher-level program, where those functions and executables can be run
  in parallel on different types of systems, such as laptops, clusters, clouds,
  and HPC.
applications: >-
  Parsl enables developers to annotate Python functions with decorators (called
  Parsl apps) and then asynchronous execute those functions on arbitrary
  parallel and distributed computing systems. Parsl apps return futures that can
  be chained together to construct dataflow-based workflows.
