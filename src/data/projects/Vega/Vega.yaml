  The Vega Projects constitute a cohesive ecosystem of visualization libraries:
  Vega is a visualization grammar; a declarative format for creating, saving,
  and sharing interactive visualization designs. Vega-Lite provides a
  higher-level grammar for visual analysis and Vega-Altair provides Python
  bindings for Vega-Lite. This grammatical implementation of graphics and
  interactivity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal
  amount of code. VegaFusion scales Vega-Altair to large datasets and VL Convert
  provides publication quality static file export.
