short_description: >-
  pyMOR is a software library for building model order reduction applications
  with the Python programming language.
technical_details: >-
  Implemented algorithms include reduced basis methods for parametric linear and
  non-linear problems, as well as system-theoretic methods such as balanced
  truncation or IRKA (Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm). All algorithms in
  pyMOR are formulated in terms of abstract interfaces for seamless integration
  with external PDE (Partial Differential Equation) solver packages. Moreover,
  pure Python implementations of FEM (Finite Element Method) and FVM (Finite
  Volume Method) discretizations using the NumPy/SciPy scientific computing
  stack are provided for getting started quickly.
