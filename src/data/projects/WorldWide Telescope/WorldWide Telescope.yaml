  Thanks to the flexibility of its underlying rendering engine, WWT is used in
  projects ranging from astrophysics research to education, public outreach, and
  simply sharing the wonder of the universe. For instance, the WWT web toolkit
  is used in the Chandra Source Catalog viewer of NASA’s Chandra X-Ray Center,
  the StarHunt student research project funded by the Nobel Prize Museum, and
  interactive educational applications created for NASA’s Bringing the Universe
  to America’s Classrooms program. The WWT Windows application has powered
  hundreds of planetariums, from small portable domes to world-class facilities
  like the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.

  WorldWide Telescope is an ecosystem of software, data sets, and services that
  combine to enable immersive, interactive astronomy data visualization.
  Building on a reusable rendering engine available in both
  TypeScript/JavaScript and C#, the WWT ecosystem includes a Windows
  application, an interactive web app with JupyterLab support, and a range of
  supporting tools.
