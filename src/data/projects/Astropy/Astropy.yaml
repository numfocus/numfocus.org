short_description: >-
  The Astropy Project provides software tools and infrastructure to facilitate
  research by professional astronomers. In addition to maintaining a core Python
  package, the Astropy Project supports the development of high-grade affiliated
  packages by members of the astronomical community.
technical_details: >-
  The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a single core python
  package for common astronomical computing tasks and to provide a framework
  which fosters interoperability between Python astronomy packages.
applications: >-
  Astropy was one of the projects used in the LIGO gravitational waves
  discovery. Astropy is used by a large and growing number of organizations and
  projects worldwide, including: the Association of Universities for Research in
  Astronomy (AURA); the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope
  pipelines, including many instrumentation support, observation planning, and
  data analysis codes; science pipelines for the forthcoming Large Synoptic
  Survey Telescope; many European Southern Observatory (ESO) instrument
  pipelines, including (e.g.) the MUSE Python Data Analysis Framework; Gemini
  Observatory’s science, data quality, and reduction pipelines; the pipeline
  framework for the Cherenkov Telescope Array; major SDSS surveys, including
  MaNGA, APOGEE, and eBOSS; codebases for the SAMI Galaxy Survey and the Close
  AGN Reference Survey; and Astropy’s table and units functionality is also used
  by organizations outside of astronomy, including the Norway Mapping Authority.
