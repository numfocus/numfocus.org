short_description: >-
  The Free Motion Capture Project (FreeMoCap) aims to provide research-grade
  markerless motion capture software to everyone for free.
technical_details: >-
  We’re building a user-friendly framework that connects an array of \`bleeding
  edge\` open-source tools from the computer vision and machine learning
  communities to accurately record full-body 3D movement of humans, animals,
  robots, and other objects. We want to make the newly emerging mind-boggling,
  future-shaping technologies that drive FreeMoCap’s core functionality
  accessible to communities of people who stand to benefit from them. We follow
  a “Universal Design” development philosophy, with the goal of creating a
  system that serves the needs of a professional research scientist while
  remaining intuitive to a 13-year-old with no technical training and no outside
  assistance. A high-quality, minimal-cost motion capture system would be a
  transformative tool for a wide range of communities – including 3d animators,
  game designers, athletes, coaches, performers, scientists, engineers,
  clinicians, and doctors. We hope to create a system that brings new
  technological capacity to these groups while also building bridges between
  them.
